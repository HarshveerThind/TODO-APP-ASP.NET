Project Summary
Description
A modern, full-stack Task Management application (CRUD) that serves as a proof of concept for a high-performance web API and responsive frontend. It follows a clean architecture similar to ASP.NET's MVC/API pattern, separating data models, business logic, and UI presentation.

The Tech Stack

Backend: Node.js with Express (Framework) and Drizzle ORM (Database mapping).
Database: PostgreSQL for reliable, structured data persistence.
Frontend: React with TypeScript, styled with Tailwind CSS.
State Management: TanStack Query (React Query) for efficient data fetching and caching.
Animations: Framer Motion for smooth UI transitions.
Key Features

Full CRUD: Create, read, update, and delete tasks in real-time.
Interactive UI: Mark tasks as complete/incomplete with immediate visual feedback.
Form Validation: Secure task creation with field validation using Zod.
Polished Design: Clean, minimal interface with "Edit" dialogs and deletion confirmations.
Type Safety: Shared TypeScript interfaces between the frontend and backend to ensure data integrity.
